# Creating a Slack App

To integrate slack into your own webapp, a first step is to create a "Slack App".

1. First, decide which Slack Workspace you want to create an app in (e.g. ucsb-cs56-f19.slack.com, or ucsb-cs-open-lab.slack.come, etc)
1. Start at: <https://api.slack.com/apps>
1. Click "Create an App"
1. You'll be asked for the name of your app and the name of your slack workspace.  Click create.
1. You'll be redirected to a page for your new Slack app.  If you scroll down that page, you'll see App Credentials, such as:
   * App ID
   * Client ID
   * Client Secret
   * Signing Secret
   * Verification Token
   
   There are also many other things you can do on that page to configure the app.
