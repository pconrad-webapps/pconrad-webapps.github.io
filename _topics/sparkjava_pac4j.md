The library Pac4J, online at [http://www.pac4j.org/](http://www.pac4j.org/) is a kind of swiss army knife for Java Web App Security.  
It can be used with SparkJava, but with many other frameworks as well.

The github repo [https://github.com/pac4j/spark-pac4j](https://github.com/pac4j/spark-pac4j) offers a bridge from SparkJava to Pac4J.

The following repo provides an example of an application that authenticates with Github, then prints out a list of all the repos
in the UCSB-CS56-Projects organization: <https://github.com/pconrad-webapps/sparkjava-pac4j-github-oauth-demo>
