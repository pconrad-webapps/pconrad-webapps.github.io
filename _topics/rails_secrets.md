# Short version

If you are managing your Heroku config vars (e.g. database passwords, OAuth Tokens) that contain secret info that should
not be in the .git repo, you need to have a strategy and use some good tools.

Two commonly used tools are:

* [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)
* [figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro)

You can also manage it by hand with a .env file that is in your .gitignore, and a .env.SAMPLE that has a template for the .env that *is* in the repo.  Then, you can use some heroku toolbelt thingies to move information back and forth.

More details below.

# Long version

Sometimes there is secret information such as passwords, oauth client id and secret 
etc. that your application needs in order to run.     However, it is a bad idea to hard code these in files
that are going to be stored in github (even in a private repo).

What is more typical is to store these in environment variables, and read them in to the application with
code such as the following example from `config/secrets.yml`

```yml
development:
  omniauth_provider_key: <%= ENV["OMNIAUTH_PROVIDER_KEY"] %>
  omniauth_provider_secret: <%= ENV["OMNIAUTH_PROVIDER_SECRET"] %>
  machine_oauth_token: <%= ENV["MACHINE_OAUTH_TOKEN"] %>      
```

Then, your repo might contain a file such as this one, called `env.sh.EXAMPLE`:

```sh
# Copy this to env.sh (which is in .gitignore) and then edit with
# values from

export OMNIAUTH_PROVIDER_KEY="your_key"
export OMNIAUTH_PROVIDER_SECRET="your_secret"
export MACHINE_OAUTH_TOKEN="personal_access_token_machine_user_with_owner"
```

As the comment indicates, the intention is that you keep this example file (with dummy values for the secret information)
in the repo as a template, while listing the "real" file, `env.sh` in the `.gitignore` so that it is NOT committed to github.

Once you have a real copy of `env.sh`, you can source it with this command.  That isn't a typo: you really do type a period, a 
space, then the filename.  This loads the environment variables into your current shell.  (This is different from `./env.sh`, because the latter will run the `env.sh` file in a subprocess, leaving your 
current environment affected.)

```
. env.sh
```

# Heroku (through the dashboard)

On heroku, the way you load the environment variables is to go to the screen that looks like this, and click on "Reveal Config Vars":
