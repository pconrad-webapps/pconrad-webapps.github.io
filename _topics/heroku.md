Heroku (<https://heroku.com>) provides entry-level hosting for webapps at no cost.  A credit card is not required for webapps that
do not exceed a minimal threshold of compute resources.

Among the platforms supported by Heroku are these:

* [Node](/topics/node)
* [Python](/topics/python) using the [Flask](topics/flask) and Django frameworks.
* [Java](/topics/java) using the [SparkJava](topics/spark_java) framework, as well as servlets (which are more complex to configure).
* [Rails](/topics/rails)
